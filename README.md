# final_project

This is my final university project.
It renders a ultrasonic signal graph into 3D using helix3d.
I'm writing this while also moving forward with my startup so occasionally I might take some shortcuts which might affect code quality.
Nonetheless, I wrote most of the code with good practices and any bugs in the code are caused by my own incompetance :D.
